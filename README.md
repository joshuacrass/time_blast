# Time Blast
This project is a learning resource designed to show how Electron, React, and webpack can work together. The react app itself, was originally written by @nataliacrass and the electron boilerplate was a fork of electron-react-tutorial

### Instructions

```bash
npm install
npm run watch

# open a new terminal
npm start

# Build
npm dist
```
for all the rest, see the package.json

You can find the release packages in the dist folder after build.

NOTE: I have only tested this on MacOS. :) Good Luck.
